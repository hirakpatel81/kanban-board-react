# kanban-board-react [Live Demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-kanban-board-2cfn2)
This is just a simple Kanban board using React JS. The kanban board contains basic functionality such as create, update and delete a task, drag and drop task. 
I have created this project as my React learning. The project covers topics such as React Hooks, reactstrap, formik etc.
